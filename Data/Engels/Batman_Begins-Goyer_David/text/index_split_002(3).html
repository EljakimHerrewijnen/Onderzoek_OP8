	<p class="block_1">The Treasure Map</p>
	<p class="block_2">Mike's science class had a great time at Muir Woods National Park. Miss Williamson, the science teacher, showed them some of the world's oldest and tallest trees. She was everyone's favorite teacher at Galileo High because her classes were always interesting and fun. She started the Galileo Science Club and Mike and Carlos were both members. There were club meetings every Wednesday afternoon after school.</p>
	<p class="block_2">When Mike and Carlos came back from Muir Woods they went to Carlos's house to talk about their summer trip.</p>
	<p class="block_2">"I'm really excited about this trip," said Carlos. "With the old pirate map we can look for the treasure."</p>
	<p class="block_2">"And if we're lucky we'll find it," said Mike.</p>
	<p class="block_2">"It won't be easy," said Carlos. "Pirates were clever people and their maps had secret messages that are difficult to understand. Do you have the map with you?"</p>
	<p class="block_2">"No, I hid it on the bookshelf in my room," said Mike. "Only Kate knows where it is."</p>
	<p class="block_2">"Do your parents know about it?" asked Carlos.</p>
	<p class="block_2">"No, not yet," said Mike. "My Mom always says, 'Be careful, it's dangerous!"</p>
	<p class="block_2">They laughed and Carlos said, "My parents are the same - everything that's fun is dangerous."</p>
	<p class="block_2">"But we'll be careful," said Mike.</p>
	<p class="block_2">"Next time let's meet at your house and we can look at the map," said Carlos.</p>
	<p class="block_2">"Good idea," said Mike. "It's all written in Spanish."</p>
	<p class="block_2">"No problem for me," said Carlos, laughing.</p>
	<p class="block_2">Friday was the last day of school and everyone talked about their exciting vacation plans. That evening Mr Sullivan told his family more about the trip, and Mike and Kate listened carefully.</p>
	<p class="block_2">"We'll sail next Wednesday from Marina Harbor and go north to Bodega Bay where we'll moor The Pelican. We'll probably stay five or six days. I have to work at Point Reyes National Seashore and the Farallon Islands, and Mom is going to help me. Now will you three be OK? Do you have something to do or will you get bored?"</p>
	<p class="block_2">"Oh, we won't get bored, Dad," said Kate, thinking about the treasure map.</p>
	<p class="block_2">"Don't worry, Dad," said Mike, "Kate, Carlos and I can stay on the beach, play in the sea or go for walks in the hills."</p>
	<p class="block_2">"Alright," said Mrs Sullivan, "you can stay on the beach but you mustn't swim in the sea. Remember, this is the Pacific Ocean and there are a lot of sharks, and they swim close to the beach. They're very dangerous."</p>
	<p class="block_2">Mike laughed and said, "We'll be careful, Mom, and we won't go swimming."</p>
	<p class="block_2">"You're free to do what you want during the day," said Mr Sullivan, "but we'll meet for dinner on The Pelican every evening at about six. If you have any problems, just call or text Mom or me on our cell phones."</p>
	<p class="block_2">Kate and Mike went upstairs and phoned Carlos.</p>
	<p class="block_2">"Hi Carlos," said Mike. "Can you come to my house right now? We can look at the map and start making plans."</p>
	<p class="block_2">"I'll be there in ten minutes," said Carlos happily.</p>
	<p class="block_2">Mike took the old treasure map from the bookshelf and put it on his desk. When Carlos arrived the three of them sat around the desk and looked at it carefully.</p>
	<p class="block_2">"Gee, this is exciting," said Carlos, touching it. "An old pirate map. Look, that's where Bodega Bay is, but it doesn't say that, it just says Baia. That's interesting because today in Spanish 'bay' is 'bahia', but maybe the spelling was different in the 1600s. Looking at this map we can see a town already existed there at that time."</p>
	<p class="block_2">"It was probably a pirate's town," said Mike. "There's a big harbor, the perfect place for pirates to hide. This is also very interesting because my book on the history of California says that Bodega Bay wasn't discovered until 1775. Looking at this map people lived in the area long before."</p>
	<p class="block_2">"Look on the corner of the map," said Kate. "There's a date, 1608."</p>
	<p class="block_2">"That's the year of the shipwreck of The Sonora," said Carlos. "Captain Salamanca probably hid his treasure that year, before the shipwreck in November."</p>
	<p class="block_2">"What else does it say on his map?" asked Mike. "Hmm, north of the town there's the word cementerio."</p>
	<p class="block_2">"In Spanish that means 'cemetery'," said Carlos. "It was probably the town cemetery."</p>
	<p class="block_2">"Near the cemetery there's a place called Hacienda Estrada," said Mike. "And there's a small river near it called Rio Estrada."</p>
	<p class="block_2">"Hacienda means a big farm or ranch, and Estrada was probably the name of the family who owned it," said Carlos.</p>
	<p class="block_2">"Look, there's a drawing of a lighthouse on the coast" said Mike.</p>
	<p class="block_2">"There's a big black 'X' east of the town with the word Agua," said Kate.</p>
	<p class="block_2">"Agua in Spanish means 'water'," said Carlos. "That was probably where the pirates got their drinking water - a water well."</p>
	<p class="block_2">"There are some red lines that go south from the town to what is now Doran Beach," said Mike.</p>
	<p class="block_2">"But where's the treasure?" asked Kate.</p>
	<p class="block_2">"Good question," said Mike. "The places on the map are probably important clues."</p>
	<p class="block_2">"We have almost a week to explore them," said Carlos.</p>
	<p class="block_2">"Why don't we start with the water well?" said Kate, excitedly. "That's a good place to hide a treasure."</p>
	<p class="block_2">"OK," said Mike and Carlos.</p>
	<p class="block_2">"That'll be the first place we look," said Mike.</p>
	<p class="block_">CHAPTER FOUR</p>
	<p class="block_1">The Treasure Chest</p>
	<p class="block_2">The Pelican left Marina Harbor in San Francisco on a foggy Wednesday morning. Early in the afternoon the Sullivans and Carlos got to the town of Bodega Bay and moored the boat at the small pier.</p>
	<p class="block_2">They had lunch and then Mr Sullivan said, "Your Mom and I have to start working and we're sailing to Point Reyes. We'll be back at the pier at dinner time. Have fun."</p>
	<p class="block_2">"Thanks," said the three friends. "See you at dinner."</p>
	<p class="block_2">They got off The Pelican and watched it sail away.</p>
	<p class="block_2">"Do you have the map?" asked Carlos.</p>
	<p class="block_2">"Yeah, it's in my bag," said Mike, looking at his watch. "It's half past two; we have about four hours before dinner time."</p>
	<p class="block_2">"This is exciting," said Kate, "we can start on our treasure hunt!"</p>
	<p class="block_2">Mike took the map out and said, "Let's start with the water well." The three friends looked at the map carefully.</p>
	<p class="block_2">"The water well is east of the town," said Carlos. "The harbor is west of the town and the hills are east - we have to go to the hills. They looked east and saw some brown hills.</p>
	<p class="block_2">"Let's explore them," said Mike, "and see if the water well is still there. We can follow this path."</p>
	<p class="block_2">They followed the path into the hills and spent the afternoon looking for the water well, but they found nothing. Lucky had a lot of fun running up and down the hills and everyone enjoyed watching him.</p>
	<p class="block_2">"I don't think there's a water well in these hills," said Kate, who was hot and tired, "and I'm thirsty."</p>
	<p class="block_2">"There's nothing in these hills," said Carlos, laughing.</p>
	<p class="block_2">"Hey, guys, it's almost five o'clock," said Mike. "It's time to go back; dinner is at half past six. On the way back we can stop at the supermarket and buy some cold drinks."</p>
	<p class="block_2">"Good idea," said Kate. "We didn't have much luck today."</p>
	<p class="block_2">"We'll explore the area south of Bodega Bay tomorrow," said Mike.</p>
	<p class="block_2">"Yeah, there are red lines that go all the way to Doran Beach," said Carlos. "Red lines probably mean something."</p>
	<p class="block_2">"I hope so," said Mike.</p>
	<p class="block_2">Dinner time was fun because Mrs Sullivan cooked a great meal and everyone had something to say about the day. After dinner they all played cards and went to bed early.</p>
	<p class="block_2">The next morning Mrs Sullivan made sandwiches for Kate, Mike and Carlos.</p>
	<p class="block_2">"Dad and I are going to go to Point Reyes again today," said Mrs Sullivan. "Where are you going?"</p>
	<p class="block_2">"Oh, we're going to take a long walk on the beach," said Kate. </p>
	<p class="block_2">"Don't forget to put on some sun protection then. See you at dinner," said Mrs Sullivan. "Have fun."</p>
	<p class="block_2">Kate, Mike and Carlos started walking south to Doran Beach and Lucky ran ahead of them. It was a beautiful, sunny day and there were a lot of people on the beach enjoying the sun. Behind the long beach there was a tall cliff.</p>
	<p class="block_2">Suddenly Carlos saw a small opening in the cliff.</p>
	<p class="block_2">"Hey, look over there," he said, "there's a small opening."</p>
	<p class="block_2">"Let's go inside and look around," said Mike. Kate, Carlos and Lucky slowly followed him.</p>
	<p class="block_2">"It's a cave," said Carlos excitedly. "Did you bring a flashlight?"</p>
	<p class="block_2">"Yeah, here it is," said Mike, turning it on. "Look, there are some stone steps that go down."</p>
	<p class="block_2">"Perhaps they go to another cave," said Carlos. "Let's go."</p>
	<p class="block_2">"Is this where the treasure is, do you think?" asked Kate.</p>
	<p class="block_2">"It's a good hiding place," said Mike, walking slowly down the stone steps.</p>
	<p class="block_2">"Gee, it's really dark and scary in here," said Kate.</p>
	<p class="block_2">The three friends walked into another cave and there was some sea water on the ground.</p>
	<p class="block_2">"It's not very dark in here," said Mike, looking up.</p>
	<p class="block_2">"There's a hole up there - a small opening," said Carlos. "And I can see the sky."</p>
	<p class="block_2">"How strange," said Kate who was a bit nervous.</p>
	<p class="block_2">They looked around the cave but it was empty. Then suddenly Carlos saw something.</p>
	<p class="block_2">"Mike, come here with your flashlight," cried Carlos. "There's something in the corner over here."</p>
	<p class="block_2">"Let's see," said Mike looking in the dark corner with his flashlight. "There's... a big old box."</p>
	<p class="block_2">"Box?" cried Kate. "It's the treasure chest!"</p>
	<p class="block_2">The three friends were surprised and looked at each other, and Lucky started barking.</p>
	<p class="block_2">"You're right," cried Mike and Carlos. They looked at the big wooden box; it was very old.</p>
	<p class="block_2">"It's the treasure," said Kate excitedly.</p>
	<p class="block_2">"But we don't know what's inside," said Carlos.</p>
	<p class="block_2">"Well, let's open it," said Mike.</p>
	<p class="block_2">"There's a big lock on it," said Kate.</p>
	<p class="block_2">"Let's break the old lock," said Mike.</p>
	<p class="block_2">Mike took a big stone and hit the lock a few times, but it didn't break.</p>
	<p class="block_2">"Here," said Kate, "try with this stone, it's much bigger."</p>
	<p class="block_2">But the old lock didn't break.</p>
	<p class="block_2">"Let me try," said Carlos, hitting the lock again. Suddenly the old lock broke and they were ready to open Captain Salamanca's treasure chest.</p>
